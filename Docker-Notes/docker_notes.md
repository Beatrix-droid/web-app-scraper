# docker notes cheatsheet
this is the first custom image I will try to to create a docker container for, so docker cheat sheet notes are contained here, Sources used:

## what is docker?
docker is a virtualization software.
in a generic OS, there is an application layer, and a kernel.  The kernel is the middle man between the application layer and the hardware. It manages memory, cpu and threads.

### docker vs virtual machine
Virtual machines will create both an abstract application layer AND a virtual kernel. So the images take up quite a lot of disk-space, and take a built to load.
Docker images on the other hand only abstract the application layer and use the host's kernel to operate. They boot up faster and take up a lot let space.
Initially they were created for linux (so a docker image could not run on windows because it was expecting to find a linux kernel and not a linux one but this has been changed)

Docker is great because different parts of an application can be packaged into an image, for every developer to install on their environment with a universal command, as opposed to doing this in the old fashioned way, where for an app each service needed to be installed differently depending on the developer's environment/

Docker thus makes the process of deploying applications and testing them a lot less error prone. Truly one procedure to follow that works on every env.

## docker images vs containers
a docker container is a running instance of a docker image.

Images are created and pushed to a registry, where developers can pull them down and work with them. The official docker registry is called "dockerhub". Unless you specify a different registry to look in, when you pull an image docker will automatically look there first. This is the main page of docker hub
<code>https://hub.docker.com/</code>

You don't need an acc on dockerhub to pull down their images

## some quick docker commands to:
-to pull an image from dockerhub: (unless the version is specified docker will pull the latest image)
 <code>docker pull {name of image}:{version}</code>

- to view downloaded local images:
<code> docker images</code>

 - to run a docker image:
 <code>docker run {name of image}:{version}</code>

 this will occupy a whole terminal session. To run a  docker image but have that terminal session free run: (the -d is used to run in detached mode)
<code>docker run -d {image name}:{version}</code>
the output returned is the id of the container running

- to view running local containers (processes)
<code>docker ps</code>
![image info](docker.png)

-to view logs of a specific running container:
<code>docker logs {CONTAINER ID}</code>

- to stop a running container
<code>docker stop {CONTAINER ID OR CONTAINER NAME}</code>

- to list all containers on the host (running or not)
<code> docker ps -a</code>

- start one or more stopped containers:
<code>docker start {container}</code>

- to start a container in detached mode with port binding and a custom container name:
<code>docker run --name {your container name (no spaces allowed)} -d -p {HOST PORT}:{CONTAINER PORT} {IMAGE NAME}:{IMAGE VERSION}</code>

so following from the above example the command would be <code>docker logs a51e21e7d79d</code>

## Container Port vs host Port
- An application inside a container runs in an isolated Docker Network.This allows us to run the same up running on the same port multiple times.

- We need to <em>expose</em>. the container port to the host.  This is achieved through port binding: bind (map) the container's port to the host's port to make the service available to the outside world. Here for example, we bind port 80 of the ngnix container to port 9000 on our host, so that we can access that ngnix service on our host by going to localhost:9000  :
![image info](port_binding.png)

-to start a container (in detached mode) and map it to a specific port on our host simply run:

<code>docker run -d -p {HOST PORT}:{CONTAINER PORT} {IMAGE NAME}:{IMAGE VERSION}</code>

for example, to map/bind port 9000 of our host's to the container running nginx (that by default runs on port 80) we type:
<code> docker run -d -p 9000:80  nginx:1.25</code>

Only one service can run on a specific port on the host.

## docker registry vs repository
Docker registry: a service providing storage. Can be hosted bby a third party like AwS or by yourself
It is a collection of repositories

Docker repository: a collection of related images with the same name but different versions

## Building your own docker images
- We want to deploy our app as a docker container. For that we need to create a "definition" of how to build an image from our application. That definition is created in a DockerFile

## DockerFile
- A DockerFile is a <em>text document</em> that <em>contains commands to assemble an image.</em>
- Docker can then build an image by reading those instructions.

- Docker starts from a parent image or "base image". It's a docker image that your image is based on.
- Docker files <em>must begin</em> with a FROM instruction..
- Build image from the specified image

Every image consists of multiple layers. This makes docker efficient because image layers can be cached, etc.

- docker file commands:
- <code>FROM</code> build this image from the specified image
- <code>RUN</code> will execute any command in a shell inside the container environment
- <code>COPY {src} {dest}</code> copies files from our machine {src} to a folder destination in the container. If you have multiple Dockerfile steps that use different files from your context, COPY them individually, rather than all at once. This ensures that each stepâ€™s build cache is only invalidated (forcing the step to be re-run) if the specifically required files change.
- <code>WORKDIR</code> the equivalent of "cd" in linux, change directory of a container
- <code>CMD</code> Like "RUN" in the docker file but it is specifically to start our application. It is the last command issued in a DockerFile

## building the image
To build the image run: 9with optional tag t)
<code>docker build -t {name}{tag/version}  {location of docker file} </code>
